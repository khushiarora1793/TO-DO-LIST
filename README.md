This project helped me to understand the practical use cases of JavaScript and build a strong foundation in JavaScript development. I also learned about the local storage API and how to use it to preserve ToDo list data even after closing the browser and retrieve them when the user reopens the app.

To install the Todo List app, use git:

```bash
git 
cd 

```
